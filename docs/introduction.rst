Introduction
============

Basic concept of TokDesigner
----------------------------

* TokDesigner is "*a*" **system code**, of which fundamental functionality is **Tokamak Simulator**, i.e. to predict everything of tokamak (density, temperature, fusion power, stability limit, wall loading, divertor heat flux, TF coil stress ... ) with a given totkamak configuration (R, a, B, Ip, ..) as input. 
|

* TokDesigner uses the theory-based integrated modeling **IPS-FASTRAN/CESOL** as a computational kernel "plus" engineering modeling
|

* Built upon the fundamental functionality as a *Tokamak Simulator*, TokDesigner provides traditional capabilities of the system code -- 1) `Filter design points`, 2) `Constrained optimization`
